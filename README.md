# Angular 2 App
This is an example of a single page app built using Angular 2 framework. I have built it following tutorial from [angular.io/](https://angular.io/)
I have added a number of my own views to this SPA.


### Server

This application runs using the [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server). To get started run following commands:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Application can be viewed on `localhost:3000`.
